![Dictionary Attack](https://github.com/ahmedmohamedbekhit1/Information_Security_Mangment/blob/main/Task1/Screen_shot.png)

This project demonstrates a basic dictionary attack simulation in a web environment. It allows users to attempt to crack a predefined password using a dictionary file.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ A simple login form for manual password entry.
- 📂 A file upload option to perform a dictionary attack.
- 📝 Console logging of each attempted password.
- 🔔 Alerts when the correct password is found or not found.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 🖊️ The user enters a password manually and clicks the "Log In" button.
2. 🎯 If the entered password matches the predefined password (`10dogs`), a success message appears.
3. 📄 The user can also upload a `.txt` file containing a list of passwords (one per line).
4. 🔍 The script attempts each password from the dictionary file and logs the attempts in the console.
5. 🛑 If the correct password is found, the script alerts the user and stops further attempts.

## 📋 Requirements

- 🌐 A modern web browser.
- 📑 A text file (`.txt`) containing a list of potential passwords (for dictionary attack testing).

## 🚀 Usage

- 🔓 Open the web page and manually enter a password to test.
- 📂 Upload a `.txt` file containing passwords to perform a dictionary attack.
- 🖥️ Check the console for password attempts and results.
