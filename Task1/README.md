# Dictionary Attack 

This project demonstrates a basic dictionary attack simulation in a web environment. It allows users to attempt to crack a predefined password using a dictionary file.

## Features

- A simple login form for manual password entry.
- A file upload option to perform a dictionary attack.
- Console logging of each attempted password.
- Alerts when the correct password is found or not found.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a password manually and clicks the "Log In" button.
2. If the entered password matches the predefined password (`10dogs`), a success message appears.
3. The user can also upload a `.txt` file containing a list of passwords (one per line).
4. The script attempts each password from the dictionary file and logs the attempts in the console.
5. If the correct password is found, the script alerts the user and stops further attempts.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser.
- A text file (`.txt`) containing a list of potential passwords (for dictionary attack testing).

## Usage

- Open the web page and manually enter a password to test.
- Upload a `.txt` file containing passwords to perform a dictionary attack.
- Check the console for password attempts and results.
